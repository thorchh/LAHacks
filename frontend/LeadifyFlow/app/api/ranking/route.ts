    explanation: "This profile is an exceptional fit. Guadalupe is a Senior Lecturer at MIT teaching AI, business, engineering, and ethics, specifically focusing on biotech and healthcare innovation. They are an AI Expert Advisor for major global bodies (World Economic Forum, European Commission, OpenAI, NIH), a published author and thought leader on AI in biotech and healthcare, and a frequent keynote speaker and guest lecturer at top universities (MIT, Harvard, Oxford). The expertise in AI ethics (mentioned in teaching), high profile, extensive speaking/educator experience, and advisory roles make them highly relevant. Crucially, they have past experience as Head & Director of Ambulatory Clinics at UCLA Health, indicating a direct connection to the event's host institution. The location (SF Bay Area) is also relatively close to UCLA for an in-person event. This combination makes them a top candidate for a keynote speaker."

He explicitly identifies as a 'Responsible AI Researcher' and 'AI Leader at AI4Good', with experience at 'Z-InspectionÂ® Trustworthy AI Labs'. His work descriptions detail projects related to AI fairness (DE&I), AI for Good applications (SDGs, education), and AI trustworthiness/policy (EU AI Act). He is also a UC Berkeley alum and located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a reasonable travel distance to UCLA. This combination of direct expertise, location, and relevant experience makes him an excellent candidate for a keynote speaker or senior panelist on AI ethics and societal impact."

She is an Adjunct Lecturer teaching 'Information Policy Strategy and Design in the Age of AI' and has extensive experience in 'Privacy and Data Policy' at Meta. Her PhD is from the UC Berkeley School of Information, where she was Co-Director of the Center for Technology, Society & Policy, focusing on multidisciplinary research on the social and policy issues of technology.

    explanation: "This profile is a very strong fit in terms of subject matter and speaking experience. Vidhi's headline and experience clearly position them as an AI Executive, Futurist, Global Keynote Speaker, and AI Educator with explicit mentions of Responsible AI and AI Governance in speaking topics. As Head of AI and a fractional Chief AI Officer, they design AI strategies, risk assessment, and governance frameworks. They also direct AI4Diversity, a nonprofit educating communities about AI, which aligns with a university audience. The major drawback is the location (UAE), making in-person attendance potentially difficult and costly. However, their status as a 'Global Keynote Speaker' suggests a willingness and capability to travel for events, indicating a high likelihood of interest if contacted."
